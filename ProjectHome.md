# About XBMCUpdate #
XBMCUpdate is the Fully Automated Update Client for [XBMC](http://www.xbmc.org)

# Features #

  * Configurable to do an update without any user interaction and exit upon completion
  * Configurable to automatically shutdown XBMC prior to update installation
  * Configurable to automatically start XBMC after a successful update installation
  * Can automatically update itself. Think of the irony if it couldn't!!!

# System Requirements #
  * XBMCUpdate has been tested on Windows XP, Windows Vista 32/64 Bit, Window 7
  * [Microsoft .NET framework](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=8CEA6CD1-15BC-4664-B27D-8CEBA808B28B&displaylang=enMicrosoft) is required for XBMCUpdate. (Pre-installed on Windows Vista and 7)

**Windows 7/Vista Users:** If you have XBMC installed in C:\Program Files\ or other system protected folders in order for XBMCUpdate to be able to update those folders it would need to be started with Administrator privileges. To start XBMCUpdate under Administrator privileges manually, right click on XBMCUpdate icon and click on "Run as Administrator".
If you have XBMCUpdate setup in windows scheduler, make sure you have the option "Run with highest privileges checked".


## Command line arguments: ##
**/Tray** -- Causes the app to launch in minimized state, recommended if you are adding XBMCUpdate to your system startup or windows schedule
**/Update** -- Causes the app to initiate and update upon start and terminate itself 5 seconds after completion.



## Examples: ##
```
xbmcupdate.exe /tray /update --start in tray, update and shutdown
xbmcupdate.exe /update -- start, update and shutdown while showing you the progress and status.
```

_If you are going to use any of these parameter. Run a manual update at least once. this will help XBMCUpdate to configure itself. it will also help you confirm that everything is in order._
